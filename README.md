Audio Intent Classification and Emotion Classification

## Initial Proposal and Motivation

Audio intent Classification is much needed in interactive voice response (IVR), understanding the intent and sentiment behind customer inquiries is crucial for enhancing service quality and satisfaction. This project proposes the development of a voice intent classification and sentiment analysis system tailored to process customer voice interactions. By leveraging state-of-the-art audio computing and natural language processing (NLP) technologies, this system aims to accurately interpret the customer's intent and sentiment from audio interactions, providing actionable insights to improve response strategies and customer experience.

As of now, my plan is to achieve Audio Intent classification using data like Skit-S2I Dataset which is a dataset for Intent classification from the Banking domain as part of query understanding process. Then as second part of the project I would like to add sentiment analysis to the voice to understand the customerâ€™s mood and take the informed decision this can be a useful feature in the IVR process.
